# Homework_2

I struggled a lot getting the image on the front page to be responsive like the ones on the portfolio. I wanted the portfolio photos to be the same size in the main page, but at least they look good on the phone. 

I wanted every aspect of the page to be responsive. So i started w. the nav. so when you make it smaller, the links will stack instead of displaying in an inline display. Then i tried to change the font-size, but it didn't really work out like I hoped. 

I have been finished with this project since yesterday and definetely have been frustrated by a few small aesthetic features like the contact page, portfolio image size, and main page image size. 

Alas, it is time to move on. I completed the required assignment and I know i shouldnt worry so much about the little things.
