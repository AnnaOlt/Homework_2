              <br> <p> Hi there! My name is Anna Olt. Short and sweet, unlike me who is tall and fiesty. I am currently studying to be a full-stack developer. I also have a full-time job, which has led me to this field. I work for my family business, which is called McRoberts Technologies. We provide risk-specific solutions for security purposes. Before last year it was called McRoberts Protective Agency and is the oldest security company in America! Started by my great, great, great grandfather in 1876, McRoberts Protective Agency was started with maritime in mind. They provided guards to secure the docks in lower manhattan, when many people were immigrating to America and coming from Ellis Island. A lot of passengers had their belongings stolen on their first day in America! What a bummer, right? And thus, the company was born. 
                      One hundred and Fourty-Four years later we are still in the security business, but have now moved on to technology. Since 1992 McRoberts has been keeping infants safe with a software called MyChild. People who have kids remember the bracelet or umbilical tags their babies were given when they were first born in the hospital. If you don't have kids, don't worry. I didn't know about it either until I transitioned into my position now: Clinical Trainer.
                      It is my job to teach the nurses how to use the software properly. When I was first introduced to the software I had so many questions about aesthetics and functionality. There were many things that did not make sense and it resembles Windows '95. When I told the CEO (my mother) what I thought she said "Yes, I know, we're working on it".
                      I have always been interested since web design. My interest was peaked in college when the class was allowed to make a website instead of writing a paper. So, I decided I would like to make the software changes on my own, since I am the company expert on the software. We currently have two developers who are swamped. So, I decided I could help my family's company while learning valuable skills that may eventually lead to a new career.
                      The company website is a mess as well. I'm looking forward to using my skills to help the company and help myself land a new sweet gig. :)
